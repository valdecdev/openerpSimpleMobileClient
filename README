Simple Mobile Client(webserver) for OpenERP Contacts
----------------------------------------------------

The aim of this project was to get a simple interface allowing contacts/partners from an OpenERP server to be available 
on the web formatted for mobile phones.

The proof of concept solution here uses the following
- Python		http://www.python.org *
- CherryPy 		http://www.cherrypy.org *
- JQueryMobile		http://jquerymobile.com **
- OpenERP 		http://www.openerp.com

and consists of one file ContactClient.py which acts both as a client to OpenERP and as a webserver for the mobile site. 

* Please note: If you have a working OpenERP Web client installed, Python and CherryPy are already installed.
** No installation is requred for JQueryMobile - this is called implicitly within the code.


Configuration
-------------
Use a text editor to edit the configuration variables in the ContactClient.py file

openerp_ip      - ip address for the openerp server (default: 127.0.0.1
server_ip       - ip address / url to serve the website (default: 0.0.0.0) (eg: your.domaim.com)
server_port     - port for the webclient (default: 8081)
session_timeout - timeout for the sessions (default: 5 mins)
db		- put your database name here (default: 'yourdatbasehere')
pagelimit	- max number of contact/partner results to show (default: 20)


Installing and Running the software
-----------------------------------
To install 
- Extract the archive or git clone git://github.com/valdecdev/openerpSimpleMobileClient.git /directory/on/your/system
to a system which has CherryPy and Python already installed.  (possibly a machine with the OpenERP Web Client installed)

To run
- cd /directory/on/your/system
- cd src
- python ContactClient.py & (runs the client in the background on a linux server)


Using the software on your mobile
---------------------------------

Check that you can  accept cookies from either visited websites or all websites.
(iPhone: Settings > Safari > Accept Cookies   either set to 'From visited' or 'Always')

Open your web browser on your mobile and enter 'server-ip:server_port' as the URL (or 'URL:server-port' accordingly).

After logging in, you can change the view from contact names to partner names by clicking the search button 
and tap the 'Search in' button to change to 'Partner'. 
Leave the 'Search' field empty and press 'Submit'.

In Contact view, clicking on a contact name initiates a pop-up window which asks for permission to call.
Clicking on the '+' symbol to the right of the contact name opens the email client with the corresponding 'To:' 
email address of the contact.

iPhone: pressing and holding the contact name opens up the iphone standard dialog with options to add 
the phone number to the iPhone addressbook, SMS etc.



Notes
-----
- Currently ignores contacts which have no partner_id.  This is because OpenERP allows Users of the system to have addresses in the res_partner_address table.

ToDo
----
- Maybe a database choice on login?
- Other bits and pieces :)
